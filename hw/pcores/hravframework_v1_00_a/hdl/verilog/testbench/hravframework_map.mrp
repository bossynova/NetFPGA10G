Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 1,080 out of 149,760    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               1,080
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        938 out of 149,760    1%
    Number used as logic:                      938 out of 149,760    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             917
      Number using O5 and O6:                   21

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,531
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           451 out of   1,531   29%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 593 out of   1,531   38%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         487 out of   1,531   31%
    Number of unique control sets:              32
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              52 out of 149,760    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       712 out of     680  104% (OVERMAPPED)

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                       5 out of     324    1%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                  5
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:               5
    Total Memory used (KB):                    180 out of  11,664    1%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network masterbank_sel_pin<2> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 619 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   masterbank_sel_pin<1>,
   masterbank_sel_pin<0>,
   S_AXI_ACLK,
   S_AXI_BVALID,
   S_AXI_WVALID
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  25 block(s) removed
   6 block(s) optimized away
  49 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
