Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   604 out of 149,760    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 604
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        529 out of 149,760    1%
    Number used as logic:                      529 out of 149,760    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             524
      Number using O5 and O6:                    5

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   231 out of  37,440    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          700
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            96 out of     700   13%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 171 out of     700   24%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         433 out of     700   61%
    Number of unique control sets:              10
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               8 out of 149,760    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       665 out of     680   97%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.39

Peak Memory Usage:  1165 MB
